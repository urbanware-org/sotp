    1. Definition

        The SOTP Writer script modifies an existing or creates a new config
        file.

    2. General stuff

        Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
        So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
        script with the "--help" argument. For example:

            $ ./sotp-writer.py --help

    3. Create a new config file

        For example, if you want to create the config file "foobar.ini" inside
        the directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

            [Settings]
            foo = 3

        the command-line would look like this:

            $ ./sotp-writer.py -a write -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" --new-file \
                               -s "Settings" -o "foo" -v "3"

    4. Write contents

        4.1 Add a new option

            For example, if you have the config file "foobar.ini" inside the
            directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

                [Settings]
                foo = 3

            and want to add the option "bar" with the value "false" to that
            section, the command-line would look like this:

                $ ./sotp-writer.py -a write -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                   -s "Settings" -o "bar" -v "false"

        4.2 Overwrite an existing option

            For example, if you have the config file "foobar.ini" inside the
            directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

                [Settings]
                foo = 3
                bar = false

            and want to overwrite the value of the option "bar" with the value
            "true", the command-line would look like this:

                $ ./sotp-writer.py -a write -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                   -s "Settings" -o "bar" -v "true"

        4.3 Add a new section

            For example, if you have the config file "foobar.ini" inside the
            directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

                [Settings]
                foo = 3
                bar = true

            and want to add the new section "User" with the option "name" and
            the value "johndoe", type:

                $ ./sotp-writer.py -a write -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                   --new-section -s "User" -o "name" \
                                   -v "johndoe"

        4.4 Force writing

            Since version 1.0.2 of SOTP, you can force writing contents to the
            config file.

            Please use the "force-write" mode with care, due to the fact, that
            it will overwrite existing files irreversibly.

            If the given config file does not exist, it will be created and
            the corresponding section, option and value written to the file.

            Otherwise, the section and option will be added to the existing
            file. In case these already exist, the value will be replaced with
            the new one.

            So, to force writing the contents, simply use the "force-write"
            instead of the "write" action:

                $ ./sotp-writer.py -a force-write -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                   -s "Settings" -o "foo" -v "3"

    5. Remove contents

          5.1  Remove an option

            For example, if you have the config file "foobar.ini" inside the
            directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

                [Settings]
                foo = 3
                bar = true

                [User]
                name=johndoe

            and want to remove the option "bar" from the "Settings" section,
            type:

                ./sotp-writer.py -a remove -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                 -s "Settings" -o "bar"

            Notice that the whole section will be removed if you do not give
            an option.

          5.2  Remove a whole section

            For example, if you have the config file "foobar.ini" inside the
            directory "/tmp" containing the following lines

                [Settings]
                foo = 3
                bar = true

                [User]
                name=johndoe

            and want to remove the whole "Settings" section from the config
            file, type:

                ./sotp-writer.py -a remove -c "/tmp/foobar.ini" \
                                 -s "Settings"
